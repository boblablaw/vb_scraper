      "summary": "At the University at Albany, SUNY, students highlight the campus's beauty and its welcoming environment, often describing it as a community where they feel a sense of belonging. Academically, experiences vary; while many appreciate the supportive professors who genuinely care about student success, others express dissatisfaction with the large class sizes and perceived lack of engagement in some programs, especially within the STEM field. Student life is vibrant, with a wide array of clubs, events, and a notable party culture, though some feel that a greater variety of late-night activities could enhance the experience. While most agree that the campus is diverse and offers ample opportunities for involvement, concerns regarding campus safety, the quality of dining options, and the adequacy of support services, particularly in academic advisement, are frequently raised. Overall, students emphasize that success at UAlbany hinges on personal effort and engagement with available resources.",
      "review_pos": "My time at UAlbany has been really good overall. I’m a junior in Computer Science with minors in Business and Informatics. The CS program can be tough, but the projects felt real, and most professors are helpful if you actually reach out. Being here has helped me grow a lot academically and personally. Living on campus was a big part of my experience. I got to meet a lot of people, and build a small community that made the campus feel like home. Thsocial and convenient, and the late-night conversations, events, and overall environment made it easy to connect with others. I also used a lot of campus resources like CAPS, TimelyCare, tutoring, and the career center, and they really helped when I needed support or guidance. There are tons of clubs and leadership opportunities if you look for them. I do think things like class registration, and dining variety could be better, but overall I’d recommend UAlbany to students who get involved and make the most out of the experience.",
      "review_neg": "Honestly, it is a real great school for sure, the campus life is great its the college experience in itself I would say but just gotta stay motivated in order to not miss classes etc..",

The food has received mixed reviews, with some praising its quality while others express disappointment about the variety and availability.

I found the campus to be cliquey and there's really not much to do around there due to the rural location.

I left for a smaller school in Boston and had a significantly better experience.",

In the 25 years since I graduated, my appreciation for the academics & overall college experience at UNH only continues to grow. UNH prepared me very well for my chosen career. It is accessible to Boston by train and in close proximity to both the coast and mountains. Toured several schools along the East coast and could not be more thrilled that my own child is choosing UNH as an OOS student! She felt the school had just the right balance of academics & rah-rah culture set in a beautiful environment.",

Many students appreciate the strong commitment from professors, who are often described as caring and invested in student success, although some departments, like chemistry and mathematics, receive criticism for inconsistent quality. While the campus is visually attractive and often noted for its outdoor beauty, students have voiced concerns about dining options and dorm conditions, suggesting there is room for improvement in those areas. Student life at Tulane is characterized by a mix of social engagement, with a focus on community service, although some reviews indicate a need for more inclusivity, particularly for underrepresented groups. The balance of academics and social activities is frequently highlighted, making Tulane appealing for those seeking both educational growth and a dynamic college life.",

Students appreciate the wide array of extracurricular activities, including sports and clubs, catering to different interests, although some note that the social scene can lean heavily toward partying. Academically, faculty care about student success, with many professors being described as supportive and accommodating, especially in smaller class settings. However, there are concerns about the efficiency of administration and larger class sizes in some programs, which can affect individual attention. While the campus and surrounding Blacksburg are praised for their beauty, some reviews mention limited off-campus diversity and social options, alongside high housing costs. Overall, students express a strong sense of belonging, often referring to Virginia Tech as a second home, filled with opportunities for personal and academic growth.",
      "review_pos": "I'm a 2025 grad with very mixed feelings about Virginia Tech. I'll start with the good, and I want to make this clear: these were the best 4 years of my life. There is so much to love about being a student here - the campus, atmosphere, clubs, school spirit, history, athletics, the party/social scene, the town of Blacksburg and the surrounding communities, and most of all, the people. I really only have one complaint about Virgina Tech. It's the academics... and education is kind of the whole point of going to college at the end of the day. My experience with the quality of teaching was extremely frustrating. I'm getting close to the character limit here but in summary, most of the professors I had were awful. I did not leave college feeling educated, academically challenged, or prepared for my career. I had to teach myself most everything from youtube/textbooks. If you just want to get a good degree and have fun doing it, go here. If you are passionate about learning, think twice.",
      "review_neg": "I've only been here for a couple of months and it's much different than what I thought it was going to be. To be fair, I had a much different idea of what college would be like before I came here. The party scene is great, same with athletics and food. However, I think my experience would be a lot better if I had a different housing situation which is making it hard to enjoy my time here.",

Some professors are passionate about teaching and engaging with students, making classes enjoyable, while others prioritize research and may not be as involved in teaching. This dynamic means students might have very different experiences depending on their professors, so it's important to seek out supportive faculty when possible."

However, there are newer residence options such as New Hall West that offer more modern amenities, including private bathrooms instead of communal ones. Living on campus is generally considered convenient due to proximity to classes and dining, though the housing lottery can be competitive."
